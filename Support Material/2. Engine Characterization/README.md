## Description

Working directory for the analysis and theoretical modeling of the Leap-1A26 engine. This folder will be updated frequently as the engine model is updated, tweaked and upgraded.

## Structure

- **Hub-to_tip**: Front LEAP-1A26 pictures to estimate the _hub-to-tip_ ratio for airflow calculations (critical for very high bypass turbofans)
- **EngineSim Outputs**: Design and testing of a LEAP-1A26 model in NASA's EngineSim. Serves as a doublecheck for the physical/ theoretical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Compilation of python notebooks used to characterize the LEAP-1A26 engine
- **Output Characteristics**: Figures with the output of the python models
