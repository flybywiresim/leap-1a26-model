## Description

MSFS Converter is an AutoHotkey script to convert from the MSFS2020 config structure to FSX/ Prepar3D (and viceversa).

The need for a _MSFS Converter_ was to be able to work with Legacy tools such as **AirDat**, **AirEd** and **AirWrench** that help with the design and fine tuning of flight and engine models.

## Instructions

- Download and install latest version of **AutoHotkey**
- Download and install **AirDat**
- Download the MSFSConverter directory
- Copy and paste all aircraft .cfg files in the main MSFSConverter path
- Edit MSFS.ini and change the _AirDat_ path
- Run MSFSConverter.ahk
- Edit both the source and target paths
- Press _Verify_ to make sure you have the minimum .cfg files needed to create Legacy aircraft.cfg and .air files
- Press _Asobo->P3D_ or _P3D->Asobo accordingly_
